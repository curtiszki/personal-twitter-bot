# personal-twitter-bot

*Built using Python **3***

This is a [twitter bot](//twitter.com/lyonweatherbot) that routinely (every 2 hours) tweets weather updates using parsed JSON data using [OpenWeatherMap's](//openweathermap.org) API. The area in question is Lyon, France. A city of approximately 2.2 million people in the southern region of France.

This code is not intended for use as you would need the API keys for both the Twitter and OpenWeatherMap APIs, both of which have not been uploaded to the repository. However, if you wish you make a bot of your own, you would have to authorize access via the [twitter API](//apps.twitter.com) to interact with one of your accounts. In this scenario, the python library [Tweepy](//www.tweepy.org/) was used to interact with the twitter API with ease.
